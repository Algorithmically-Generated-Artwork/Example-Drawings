# Algorithmically Generated Artwork - Example Drawings

## Description
This repository stores example drawings that were generated by the [Geometric Patters](https://michaelwehar.wordpress.com/2022/06/16/algorithmically-generated-visual-designs-geometric-patterns/) drawing algorithm.  Each drawing is assigned a unique id and comes in three different formats:

- In the [images](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Example-Drawings/tree/main/images) folder, you will see the final drawing in a **.png** file format.
- In the [gifs](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Example-Drawings/tree/main/gifs) folder, you will see an animation of how the drawing was generated in a **.gif** file format.
- In the [commands](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Example-Drawings/tree/main/commands) folder, you will see a sequence of commands in a **.js** file that can be used to recreate the drawing within an [HTML Canvas](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_canvas.asp).

Also, the [params](https://github.com/Algorithmically-Generated-Artwork/Example-Drawings/tree/main/params) folder contains a **.js** file with the parameters that were used to create the drawing.
